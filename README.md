## Brief Background on Project Structure and Content:
### Provided by Jamie Vazquez Madera
### Course ECE5831 Pattern Recognition & Neural Network by Dr. Jaerock Kwon

#### The project consists of running three instances of the YOLO models, which are YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv11; on a subset size of the RarePlanes dataset. The dataset is narrowed to the Real Version of images and is categorized as test only. No training was involved and no custom architecture was provided. 

#### The project is run on Python 3.9.18 and only requires users to install Ultralytics package and build the necessary directory tree to contain all data files. The rest is automatic such as setting up image extraction, allocation, model retrieval and setup, and model inferencing alongside metrics/processed image extracted.
